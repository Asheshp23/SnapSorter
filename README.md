# SnapSorter

SnapSorter is a Swift-based iOS app that uses Core ML to perform image classification and group similar images together. With SnapSorter, users can easily sort and organize their photo library, making it easier to find and access their favorite photos. The app includes a user-friendly interface with a photo picker for selecting images, and uses the MobileNetV2 model for image classification. The source code is available on GitHub for anyone interested in exploring or contributing to the project.
